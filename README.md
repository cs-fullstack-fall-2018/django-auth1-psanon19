# django-auth1

Create a blog app that will allow a pre-created user to log in and see all posts assigned to them. A user's post should include a username, blog title, blog entry, and date it was created. The index/root localhost page should show a logged in user's personal blog entries. If a user is not logged in, it should ask them to log in.

The pre-created user and the blog entries are created in the localhost/admin page.

Extra work:
Create a new page that will show all blog entries and create a link to the new page on all existing pages.
